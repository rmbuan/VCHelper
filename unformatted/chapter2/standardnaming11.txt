Standard Naming


There is a big push in the industry to start using naming conventions . This started in Visual Basic many years ago. It is just now being brought into the Visual C++ language. It has been tried before but now seems to be accepted by a greater amount of programmers . So throughout this course the naming conventions will be strictly enforced.

When reading code, it makes sense that when you see a variable, that you would know what data it was supposed to hold as well as the date type. This is accomplished by using proper naming conventions.

The variable name should also provide the information of what data the variable should hold.  This is done by giving the variable a useful name. For instance : If you are trying to store a mortgage rate in a double then the variable should be declared in the following manner.     double dMortgageRate 

This gives the programmer, that is reading your code, the exact idea of what should be stored in that variable. The lower case d stands for double the data type and MortgageRate is self explanatory as to what is will hold. The mortgage Rate. 

The capitialization of the first letter of the first word and the first letter of the second word makes reading the variable easier.
