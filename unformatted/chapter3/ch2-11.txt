Problem Statement :

Create a window that is displayed in the center of the screen.   Then create a window that is half the size of the original and appears in the top left corner of the screen.  It is your duty to explain the difference between the two windows ( remember to try your windows in different resolutions ). Then explain, in what circumstances would each window be used for.
