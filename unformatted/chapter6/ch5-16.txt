Exercise 2

In this exercise you  will build a build a Toolbar from scratch. The graphics will be simple, nothing that will take any time at all.

Here are the steps that you will do to complete this exercise.

1) Create a new project
2) Create the Application and Window Class
3) Create a simple menu  (  File , with Open, Close and Exit )
4) Write the message handlers and build the message map for each of the menu options
5) Create three bitmaps in paint. ( The bitmaps have to be 16 X 15 pixels. This can be done by using the Image - > Attribute menu option in paint. The image should be a square with different colours.  Where Open will be red, Close will be blue and Exit will be black.)
6) Create a new bitmap which is (16 X 15) X 3 or 48 X 15.
7) Paste the coloured bitmaps onto the new bitmap just created. This is how all toolbars are created. It is easier in the GUI environment. This exercise will re-enforce what is really happening.
8) Then define the bitmap in the resource file.
9) Create the TButton Structure, keeping in mind how many buttons you will be using
10)  Add the buttons
11)  Run your program ( only buttons appear , no image.  Test the buttons)
12) Add the bitmap  
13) Run the program again and you will see the images.  Test the buttons.
