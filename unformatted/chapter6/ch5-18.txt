Creating your First Window
Using the Graphical Interface

Now, we will experiment with the Graphical Interface of Microsoft Visual Studio , Visual C++ Version 6.0. This is the type of programming that you will be doing in the real world, the development time is shorter. We will be using the wizards. The wizards will generate a lot of code for you. By now you are probably tired of creating the Window and Application classes. The wizard will create these for you.

Let's get to it.

Your project is now created. The window class and the application class has been created for you. It has also created the CChildview class. This class is ignore during this course.

It has created the following classes :

CChildView Your view class ( how to display class )

Build the application and you will see that it will run. Then select the File- > Exit program. The application will terminate. Click on the About box and you will be displayed an Description of the FirstGui application. You will notice that all the other menu items are gray out. You can not click on them.

Now to the environment

The environment will open up and display the class view. The + sign beside the FirstGui classes can be clicked on and all the classes will be exposed. The classes are : CAboutDlg CFirstGuiApp, CMainFrame and CChildView. Each one of these classes will have the + sign to the left of them. This indicates that there are more files inside. These files, are really functions. 

The most common icons that you see, in class view are described below.
