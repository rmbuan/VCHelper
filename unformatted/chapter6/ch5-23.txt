Project 

Step One

This is the start of the project. There will additional activities to add to this project in the future chapters of this course. The project will be a address book. It will allow you to keep track of your friends , family members and corporate contacts all in one place.

In this chapter you will create the main window, with a menu and toolbar. Follow the steps below to create Step one of the project.

1. Create a window , with no document view support and a toolbar. The project name should be AddressBook.

2. Create the menu, as is available in the Animate button. ( not required to put any code in the menu options yet. This was done for documentation purposes only)

File     
    New IDM_NEW New Contact\nNew 
   Open IDM_OPEN Open Contact Information 
     Exit ID_APP_EXIT Terminate application

6. Create the additional toolbar options with the proper tooltips and status bars.
To create the tool bar, Use the menu graphics editor and type the letters in. You should change this prior to the application being completed later in the course.

7. Save the project in the MFC Course folder.

Hints : Use the toolbar that is presently in the default toolbar and paint the background gray. Add text using the Ariel font , regular and size 8.  If you drag the blank toolbar button to the left it will  be placed in the proper sequence.
