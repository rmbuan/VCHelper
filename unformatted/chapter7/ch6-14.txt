Exercise One

This exercise will teach a few things about laying out Dialog Boxes and a little about business applications. 

This application will start with a main window. 
The main window will have a simple menu that will have File and Help as the top level menus.
The File menu will have two options Open and Exit.
The Help will have About.

The purpose of the Exercise will be, to  have a Dialog Box open when the user selects Open. The program will exit when the user clicks Exit.

The About box will pop up with your name, when the user selects About. Below you will find a sample of the format  for a label. 
                    CTEXT "Displayed Label", IDD_Label,X,Y,Width,Height

The Dialog Box will Show the information that will identify a person. Think of it as a personal address book. The following items would normally appear in a personal address book.

First Name, Last Name , Address and phone number. 

Use the CText as a static text label and the EDITTEXT for the input box. Try several different layouts to make sure that the Dialog Box looks presentable.
