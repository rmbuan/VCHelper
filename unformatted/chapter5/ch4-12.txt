Exercise 2 

This will give a more business like format for the used for a message box. You will be using both the global message box and the application message box. The application will place a message box that appears prior to the startup of the application and then will prompt the user when he/she terminates the application.

The steps involved are listed below.

1) Create a Window class derived from CFrameWnd 
2) Create an Application class derived from CWnd 
3) Setup the message map for the WM_CHAR message  
4) You will also have to set up the message handler for the above message. 


Notice that the first two steps are the same. This time we will only be using the WM_CHAR message.

5) Prior to the window appearing , you will prompt the user to determine whether the user has   chosen to start this application in error or not. Use the OK/Cancel buttons and the warning icon. 
6) if the user choses Cancel terminate the application. 
7) If the user choses Ok then start the application. 
8) Once the window has been opened, the user should be prompted with the message displayed on the window to press any key. This will be done using the TextOut( ) function from the last chapter. 
9) The user presses a key and a message box appears informing the user that the application is about to close. Do you want to save the data , should be the prompt , with a question mark and the Yes/No buttons. 
10) If the user chooses Yes terminate the application. 
11) If the user chooses NO, the application should close the message box and re-display the messaage prompt at the same location as the orginal message prompt when the application started and should prompt the user to hit another key.
