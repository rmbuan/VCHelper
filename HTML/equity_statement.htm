and community partners and seeks to create a welcoming environment where equity,
diversity and safety of all groups are fundamental. Language or activities which
are inconsistent with this philosophy violate the College policy on the
Prevention of Discrimination and Harassment and will not be tolerated. The
commitment and cooperation of all students and staff are required to maintain
this environment. Information and assistance are available through your Chair,
Student Affairs, the Student Association or the Human Rights Advisor.</font></p>
