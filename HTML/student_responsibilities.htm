RESPONSIBILITIES:&nbsp;</font></h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should obtain a copy of the Student
Handbook and refer to it for additional information regarding the
grading system, withdrawals, exemptions, class assignments, missed tests and
exams, supplemental privileges, and academic dishonesty. Students are required
to apply themselves diligently to the course of study, and to prepare class and
homework assignments as given. Regular attendance, though not a requirement, is
strongly advised. Past student performance shows a strong relationship between
regular attendance and success.</font></p>
